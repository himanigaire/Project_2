<!-- We use the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to specify that the document is in HTML5.
Steps Explained:
Meta Tags: We include meta tags to define the character set, viewport settings, and compatibility mode for the webpage. These tags help ensure proper rendering and accessibility across different devices and browsers.

Title: We set the title of the webpage to "Personal Portfolio" using the <title> tag within the <head> section. The title appears in the browser tab. 

Style: We use internal CSS to style the webpage, setting the font family, margins, padding, and line height for the body. We also style the header, sections, and footer with specific colors, padding, and alignment.

Header: Inside the <body>, we use a <header> tag containing an <h1> element with the title "Himani Gaire" and paragraph using <p> element.The header visually appears at the top of the webpage and is used to introduce the main content.

Sections: We use <section> tags to divide the content into different sections: "About Me," "Skills," and "Contact." Each section contains a heading and relevant information. In the "Skills" section, we use an unordered list <ul> to list different skills.

Footer: The <footer> tag contains the copyright information "Â© 2024 Himani Gaire" (used copyright law's logo by writing &copy;) and appears at the bottom of the page, providing information about the creator of the webpage. We also style the footer to have a dark background color and white text.We kept it relative so that it stays at the end of the page.
